Pitch: A simple soup kitchen management software that allows inventory tracking and easy user sign up. 

MVP Features Breakdown:

Login page: simple form for a user login flow. Users can enter username and password and login or sign up as a soup kitchen manager. 

Home Page: a grid list of inventory items, (uncategorized for MVP, stretch will be to add categories) that a soup kitchen manager can use to track units, weights, quantities etc. 

Add inventory item page: User can add a new item in their inventory to create an item. i.e. potatoes: '20lbs'

Edit inventory item: user can edit the quantity, amount, weight or value of an item in their kitchen. 
If an inventory item reaches a '0' (or low threshold) quantity, make sure to indicate to the manager that they need to restock the item by showing that item as out of stock etc. 

Stretch Goal: Add a 'volunteer' sign up section where users can login and see kitchens in need of volunteers to help serve those in need.
